# Bug Report: Job Description Expansion Failure on Orientation Change

**Project:** LinkedIn Android Application    
**Severity:** Medium / UI 
**Environment:** Samsung M14 (Android 15), Resolution 1080 x 2408  

---

## Summary
The "See more" button in the job description section becomes unresponsive if the device orientation is changed immediately after navigating to a job offer. The issue persists even after returning to the original orientation, preventing the user from reading the full job description.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch the LinkedIn application.
2. Navigate to the **Jobs** tab.
3. Tap on any job posting to open the **Job Details** view.
4. Change the device orientation (Portrait -> Landscape) or (Landscape -> Portrait).
5. Attempt to tap the **"See more"** button to expand the text.
6. Rotate the device back and try to tap the button again.

## Expected Result
The job description should expand and collapse correctly regardless of any screen orientation changes.

## Actual Result
The "See more" button is completely unresponsive. The job description remains in its collapsed state, and the UI does not react to touch events on the expansion trigger.

## Technical Analysis (Logcat Insights)
Based on the provided logs, the issue is likely related to **Configuration Change** handling and deprecated layout attributes:

* **Layout Constraints Errors:** Multiple errors from `com.linkedin.android` indicate the use of deprecated attributes:
    * `E/ConstraintLayout: layout_constraintWidth_default="wrap" is deprecated.`
    * `E/ConstraintLayout: layout_constraintHeight_default="wrap" is deprecated.`
    * *Observation:* During the `onConfigurationChanged` event (orientation shift), these layout errors coincide with the button becoming unresponsive. This suggests a potential failure in the View binding or state restoration process after the activity/fragment recreation.

## Possible Workaround
Restarting the Activity by navigating back to the search results and re-entering the job offer restores functionality.
