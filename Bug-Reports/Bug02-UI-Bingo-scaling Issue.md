# Bug Report: "Super Offers" Popup UI Scaling Issue

**Project:** Bingo: Love in Montana  
**Severity:** Low / UI  
**Environment:** Samsung M14 (Android 15), Resolution: 1080 x 2408  

---

## Summary
The "Super Offers" popup window does not scale correctly to the device screen aspect ratio. As a result, the window elements are partially cut off at the edges.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Launch the application.
2. Wait for the main menu to load.
3. Tap on the "Super Offer" popup on the left side of the screen.

## Expected Result
The "Super Offers" window should be fully visible, with all UI elements correctly scaled within the screen boundaries.

## Actual Result
The "Super Offers" window is oversized. Parts of the UI are rendered outside the visible screen area due to incorrect aspect ratio adaptation.

---

## Workaround
Users can still interact with the visible part of the offer, but the close button or final price might be difficult to reach.
