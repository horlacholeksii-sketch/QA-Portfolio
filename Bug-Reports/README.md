# Bug Reports Gallery

Here are a few examples of how I document defects. I focus on clarity, technical details (like logs), and clear steps to reproduce.

### Mobile Testing (Galaxy4Games)
* **[Android Crash Case](./mobile-crash-log.md)** – A real crash report from "Match 3 Stars" development. Includes an ADB Logcat snippet to show the root cause.
* **UI/UX Issues** – Examples of layout bugs found across different Android screen ratios.

### Autodesk Event (Dec 2025)
* I participated in a one-day testing event where I reported **5 bugs**.
* **[Sanitized Sample](./autodesk-event-sample.md)** – One of the reports from the event, rewritten to respect the NDA while showing my reporting style.
