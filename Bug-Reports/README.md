# Bug Reports & Quality Documentation

This directory contains samples of defect reports and testing documentation created during my professional experience and specialized testing events. These samples demonstrate my ability to identify, document, and track software issues using industry-standard tools and methodologies.

## Featured Samples

### 1. Mobile Game Testing (Galaxy4Games)
Reports focused on the Android platform, utilizing **Android Studio** and **ADB (Logcat)** for technical analysis.
* **[Android Crash Log Sample](./mobile-crash-log.md):** A high-priority defect identified in "Match 3 Stars: PVP Champions" with attached stack trace analysis.
* **UI/UX Inconsistency:** Issues found during regression testing on various real devices and emulators.

### 2. Software Testing (Autodesk Event)

* **Summary:** Clear and concise bug titles.
* **Steps to Reproduce:** Precise, numbered sequences.
* **Expected vs. Actual Results:** Highlighting the discrepancy in software behavior.
* **Environment Details:** Device specs, OS versions, and build numbers.
