# Bug Reports Gallery

This folder contains documentation examples demonstrating my defect reporting style. It is divided into professional experience and independent quality research across different software domains.

## Professional Experience: Mobile Testing
Defects identified during active development and beta phases at **Galaxy4Games**.

* **[Android UI Layout Issue](./mobile-ui-bug.md)** — A layout defect identified on a 20:9 screen ratio. Includes reproduction steps and visual evidence.

## Independent Quality Research
To demonstrate reporting skills across diverse environments, I perform independent testing of widely used applications and professional tools.

* **[Social Media: LinkedIn](./Bug01-LinkedIn-Log.md)** — A functional defect identified in the mobile web version. Includes an ADB Logcat snippet to show the root cause.
* **[Engineering Software: Revit-to-Robot](./Bug04-Revit-Robot-Transfer.md)** — A complex integration bug involving data synchronization between BIM and structural analysis tools.

## Testing Events
* **Autodesk Beta Testing Event: Dec 2025** Participated as a guest tester for pre-release professional software. Identified and documented multiple functional and UI defects. 
  *Note: Specific project details and reports from this event are protected under a 5-year NDA and are not included in this portfolio.*
